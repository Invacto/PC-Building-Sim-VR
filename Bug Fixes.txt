Problems to resolve

- Motherboard floats and spins when all componenets attached to it

- Smooth out weird interatctions between all parts, 
-Fix case movement, should not be able to move from individual parts

- Add motherboard slot on case
- Add PSU slot on case
- Add HDD slots and SSD Slots on case

- Make a script that stores GameObject of the attached components, this is how the program will know if everything is in place
	- this srcipt can also disable rigidbody colliisions between each other so the compoenents wont spint a
